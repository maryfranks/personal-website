        <div class="about-me">
          <p>I can’t imagine a life that is not full of learning.  As a child, I eagerly read through the public library in the small town where I grew up.  As a PhD candidate in Ancient History, I have learned to read many languages and to engage with diverse and complex topics in the study of Classical Antiquity.  My research into ancient Rome has been a fulfilling journey, allowing me to continue learning new and exciting things every day.</p>
          <p>My PhD gives me the skills to excel as a web developer.  My work with classical languages has prepared me to learn new languages (programming languages included) and to work with documentation to solve complex problems (whether it’s the Oxford Latin Dictionary or the Rails API).  I was initially drawn to the study of antiquity because of the challenges of learning ancient languages.  The challenge of learning new programming languages is what draws me to web development.</p>
          <p>My research has made me detail oriented and has allowed me to work on my own projects at my own pace.  I enjoy keeping up with developments in my field (and in technology) and have embraced the lifelong learning aspects of both fields.  My attention to detail has ensured that the work I have presented at major conferences is always top notch.  I have proven (to myself most importantly) my ability to learn difficult skills in my struggle throughout my MA and early PhD to master Classical Greek.  Most importantly, I have learned through interpreting ancient texts that there is often more than one right answer, so long as all of those answers are based in sound methodology and mastery of ancient languages.  My time as a teaching assistant has made me a better communicator and a better teacher, both of myself and of others.</p>
          <p>I have long been interested in where the ancient world and modern technologies meet.  My work as co-webmaster for my blog, the Library of Antiquity, has deepened my appreciation for the important role that new technologies can play even for the study of antiquity.  Web applications like the Perseus Project have radically changed the way students approach texts.  My blog attempts to help students use the amazing digital tools available to them in new and interesting ways.  At Bitmaker, I gained a new understanding for the complexity of those projects and how they, like all open source projects, depend on developers volunteering their time to contribute to them.  As a web developer, I look forward to the ability to contribute to those projects.</p>
